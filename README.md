1. **BehindTheName**: This program displays information on the user's name in a friendly way on the console. It will ask for the name, look up the name in [BehindTheName](http://www.behindthename.com/)'s database, extract the HTML doc, and parse it for the relevant data, such as gender, usage, and meaning of the name.
